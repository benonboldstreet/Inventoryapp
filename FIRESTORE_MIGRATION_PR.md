# Firebase Firestore Migration PR

## Summary

This PR completes the migration from Room database to Firebase Firestore for our Android inventory management app. All compilation errors have been resolved and the app now uses the new data model classes consistently throughout the codebase.

## Changes Made

1. Fixed ViewModels to use model classes instead of database entities
   - ItemViewModel, StaffViewModel, and CheckoutViewModel now use the correct data types
   - Added Factory companion objects for proper dependency injection

2. Implemented repository methods that were missing or incomplete
   - Added getCurrentCheckouts implementation in CloudCheckoutRepository
   - Implemented generateTestCheckouts in FirestoreTestDataGenerator
   - Fixed all repositories to use idString property instead of id

3. Updated all UI components to use model classes
   - Fixed 22 files with import and field access issues
   - Ensured consistent use of model.Item, model.Staff, and model.CheckoutLog

4. Fixed field access issues
   - Resolved issues with position and phone fields in StaffDetailScreen and StaffListScreen
   - Fixed barcode scanning and checkout functionality

## Testing Done

- Verified compilation success with all fixed files
- Organized fixes systematically as tracked in FIRESTORE_MIGRATION_STATUS.md

## Remaining Work

- Test each screen thoroughly to ensure functionality is preserved
- Test offline synchronization to verify the PendingOperation system works with Firebase
- Conduct end-to-end testing of core features:
  - Item and staff management
  - Checkout process with and without photos
  - Barcode scanning
  - Report generation

## Known Issues

- None - All compilation errors have been resolved
