# Inventory Application Status Report

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Fixed Gradle Configuration Issues**:
   - Added the kotlin-kapt plugin for Room annotations
   - Downgraded Kotlin from 1.9.22/1.9.23 to 1.8.21 for compatibility
   - Simplified build.gradle.kts files
   - Added Material Icons Extended dependency

2. **Created Missing Database Entities**:
   - Added `Item.kt`, `Staff.kt`, and `CheckoutLog.kt` database entity classes
   - Added corresponding DAO interfaces

3. **Added Model Converters**:
   - Created `ModelConverters.kt` to bridge between database entities and cloud models
   - Implemented proper conversion functions for all model types

4. **API Documentation**:
   - Created `API_ENDPOINTS.md` with clear documentation for future cloud integration
   - Created `TESTING_GUIDE.md` to explain how to test with mock data

## Remaining Issues

1. **Type Mismatches**:
   - There are still type mismatches between database entities and model classes in:
     - ViewModels (ItemViewModel, StaffViewModel, CheckoutViewModel)
     - SyncController
     - BarcodeManager

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - ProcessLifecycleOwner is referenced but not included
   - Some Compose UI elements are not being resolved

3. **Duplicate Class Declarations**:
   - There are redeclarations of `User`, `UserRole`, `PendingOperation`, etc.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Type Mismatches**:
   - Update ViewModels to consistently use the appropriate type (model vs entity)
   - Apply model converters at repository layer boundaries

2. **Add Missing Dependencies**:
   - Add androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-process for ProcessLifecycleOwner
   - Ensure all necessary Compose dependencies are included

3. **Remove Duplicate Classes**:
   - Resolve redeclaration issues by removing or renaming duplicate classes

4. **Implement Proper Repository Pattern**:
   - Create repositories that handle the conversion between model and database entities

Once these issues are fixed, the app should build successfully and be ready to test with the mock data before progressing to cloud integration.

# Firebase Migration Status Report

## What's Been Fixed
- Duplicate class declarations (User, UserRole, PendingOperation, OperationType, SyncStatus)
- Added missing BuildConfig placeholder
- Fixed model classes with required fields
- Updated mapper classes to work with Firestore

## Remaining Issues

### Compose UI Imports
- Many UI screens (LoginScreen, SettingsScreen) are missing basic Compose imports
- Solution: Add proper imports for all Compose elements

### Type Mismatches
- ViewModels are trying to use database entities instead of model classes
- Solution: Update ViewModels to work with model classes consistently

### Missing Repository Methods
- Functions like `getCheckoutLogsByItem`, `getCurrentCheckoutForItem` are missing
- Solution: Implement these in repository classes

### toDatabase/toModel Method Calls
- Old mapper calls are being used but the functions have been replaced
- Solution: Update to use new Firestore mappers

## Next Steps
1. Fix Compose imports in UI screens
2. Update ViewModels to use new model types
3. Implement missing repository methods
4. Update all `toDatabase()` calls to use `toMap()` instead
5. Fix the controller layer to properly connect UI with data

This will require significant refactoring, but the core model structure is now in place.
