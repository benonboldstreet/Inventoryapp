        <b>How Cloud Synchronization Works:</b>\n\n
        
        1. <b>Online Mode:</b> When connected to the internet, all changes are immediately synchronized with the Firebase Firestore database.\n\n
        
        2. <b>Offline Mode:</b> When offline, changes are stored locally in the OfflineCache, and a PendingOperation is created to track what needs to be synced when online again.\n\n
        
        3. <b>Automatic Synchronization:</b> When the app detects an internet connection after being offline, it automatically processes all pending operations in the background.\n\n
        
        4. <b>Connection Indicator:</b> The cloud status icon in the top right of the screen shows if you\'re currently connected (cloud with checkmark) or disconnected (cloud with line through it).\n\n
        
        5. <b>Manual Sync:</b> You can tap the cloud icon when disconnected to attempt to reconnect and sync changes.
