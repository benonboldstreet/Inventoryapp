# Firebase Migration Summary

## What We Did

- Moved from Room database to Firebase Firestore
- Got the app working with real-time data
- Fixed the archive functionality
- Set up proper document structure in Firestore

## Files We Cleaned Up

- Removed old mock data: `mock_data.json`
- Removed unused repositories:
  - `CloudItemRepository.kt`
  - `CloudStaffRepository.kt`
  - `CloudCheckoutRepository.kt`
- Removed mock service: `MockApiService.kt`
- Moved old API specs to docs_archive

## Still Needs Work

- Fix UI updates when data changes
- Improve network error handling
- Need to remove a few more legacy files when we get time
- Add more database security

## Benefits

- No need for a separate backend server (cheaper)
- App works offline
- Real-time updates when online
- Easier to add new features

This migration took about 1-2 weeks of actual coding work, with some additional time spent testing and fixing issues with the database structure.
