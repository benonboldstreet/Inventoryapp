# Firebase Migration Cleanup Notes

## What We Cleaned Up

We removed several files that aren't needed now that we've switched to Firebase:

### Deleted Files
- `mock_data.json` - Old test data file
- `MockApiService.kt` - Mock service for testing
- `CloudItemRepository.kt` - Old repository implementation
- `CloudStaffRepository.kt` - Old repository implementation
- `CloudCheckoutRepository.kt` - Old repository implementation

### Archived Files
- Moved `api-spec.yaml` to docs_archive folder

## Why We Did This

1. **Cleaner code** - Less confusing for anyone else who needs to work on this
2. **Smaller app** - Removing unused files keeps the app smaller
3. **Easier maintenance** - No accidentally updating code that isn't used

## What's Still Left To Clean Up

We should eventually remove:
- `NetworkModule.kt`
- `AuthNetworkModule.kt`
- Any other API-related files

These are a bit more complicated to remove because other parts of the code still reference them, so we'll need to be careful when removing them.
