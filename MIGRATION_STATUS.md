# Firebase Migration Status Report

## Strategy Implemented

We're taking an incremental approach to migrate the app from Room database to Firebase Firestore:

1. First, we've consolidated duplicate model classes into single model classes in the `com.example.inventory.data.model` package.
2. We've created adapter methods to bridge between old and new code during the transition.
3. We've updated key files like ItemViewModel and SyncController to use the new model classes.

## Completed Steps

- [x] Consolidated duplicate User and UserRole classes
- [x] Consolidated duplicate PendingOperation, OperationType, and SyncStatus classes
- [x] Created ItemViewModelAdapter to help transition between database entities and Firestore models
- [x] Created a BuildConfig placeholder class to fix missing references
- [x] Added DtoAdapters.kt for the conversion between models and DTOs
- [x] Updated ItemViewModel to use the repository directly with model classes
- [x] Updated SyncController to use model classes instead of database entities
- [x] Fixed NetworkModule.kt to handle Firestore objects correctly
- [x] Resolved toDto() method conflicts (updated to toNetworkDto/toModel naming convention)
- [x] Updated StaffViewModel to use new model pattern
- [x] Updated CheckoutViewModel to use new model pattern
- [x] Fixed missing Compose imports in LoginScreen

## Remaining Issues

### 1. UI Components
- [ ] Fix missing Compose imports in SettingsScreen and other screens
- [ ] Update UI components to work with model objects instead of database entities

### 2. Repository Implementation
- [ ] Update CloudItemRepository to use Firestore operations
- [ ] Update CloudStaffRepository to use Firestore operations
- [ ] Update CloudCheckoutRepository to use Firestore operations

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining UI components with missing Compose imports
2. Update repository implementations to use Firestore operations directly
3. Test the app with Firebase Firestore integration
4. Perform a clean build to ensure there are no compilation errors

This incremental approach will allow us to make steady progress while ensuring the app remains functional at each step.
